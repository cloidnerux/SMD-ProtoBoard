# SMD-ProtoBoard
SMD prototyping board for making that quick prototype.
Designed to fit in the 5cm^2 limit of the cheapest elecrow offer
Designed with Altium Designer, the used gerbers for ordering are in the "Protoboard.zip"

Stuff that can be better:
* Add solder resist around the pads
* Make a special region for QFN and other packages with elongated pads for easy access
* Make regions with VIAs to access power pads on the bottom side of packages
* Include common connectors(USB, DSUB) on PCB border
* Check more footprints if they fir the grid, if not perhaps change the grid
* Test other grid patterns(log, X/Y-different size)
* Go to 4 layer and allow power supply over the two core layers for easier prototyping
